# Freelance Data Collective

## Who are we?

This collective was started by a group of freelancers from Berlin, but is international. 
Our ambition is to be the go-to for freelance data work around Data warehousing, Business Intelligence and ML, aimed at an international market.

The core behind this collective is that together we are stronger than alone. To achieve this, we share information and resources.

## What for?

## Finding or sharing work

Each senior freelancer has their own sources for projects which should be more than the work they can take, such that they can cherry pick.

The work a freelancer can not take can be posted as projects in our slack, and depending on your relationship with the client, you may charge a finder's fee.
### Guideline:

A typical rate for sharing information about a project can be 0-20%, depending on how close you are to the client. A usual rate is between 5 and 10%.
### Rule:
If you wish to re-share a project and charge a fee, then redirect contact to yourself and be explicit about any expectations. 
The group does not assume legal responsibility to resolve issues - instead, any cheaters will be kicked from the group.


## Using shared code

We maintain a repository of code that you can use in your client deployments. 
We encourage participation to the codebase, but it is not required.
